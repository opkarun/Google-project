Our selected code uses a robust approach to build a dynamic movie list from a CSV file. It correctly uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch the file, a parseCSV function with a regular expression to handle complex data, and then creates and styles the HTML elements for each movie. Overall, the script is a well-structured and functional example of how to combine data parsing and front-end development.
